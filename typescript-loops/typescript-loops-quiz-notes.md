## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

1. Code Reusability: Execute a block of code multiple times
2. Working with Collections: Being able to iterate over iterable objects (e.g. arrays)
3. Performance: More efficient than repeating code
4. Control Flow: Control the flow in combination with conditional statements

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  Control the flow; stopping condition

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  A single run through of a loop, or the block of code

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  AFTER the execution of the code block

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  ONCE BEFORE the execution of the code block

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  AFTER the execution of the code block

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  EVERY TIME after the execution of the code block

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  Adds 1 to the value of the variable and assigns the resulting value to the same variable.
