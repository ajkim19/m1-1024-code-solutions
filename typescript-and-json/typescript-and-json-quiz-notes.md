## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is JSON?
  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It resembles JavaScript object literals.

- What are serialization and deserialization?

  Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later.

  Deserialization is just the opposite.

  - JSON deserialization is the process of transforming the **string representation**, which was possibly stored or sent over a network, into a data structure or **object state**.

- Why are serialization and deserialization useful?

  With regards to web development, it is useful for sending data from a server to a client or the other way around (vice versa).

  JSON.stringify()
