## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `event.target`?
  It refers to the element that triggered the event.

- What is the effect of setting an element to `display: none`?
  It hides the element without taking any space.

- What does the `element.matches()` method take as an argument and what does it return?
  It takes a selector string as an argument and returns a boolean that is dependent on whether or not 'element' matches the selector.

- How can you retrieve the value of an element's attribute?
  By attaching the 'getAttribute()' method to the element with the desired attribute as a string for the argument

- At what steps of the solution would it be helpful to log things to the console?
  All of them as you code

- If you were to add another tab and view to your HTML, but you didn't use event delegation, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
  You would have to add an event listener for each element.

- If you didn't use a loop to conditionally show or hide the views in the page, how would your TypeScript code be written instead?
