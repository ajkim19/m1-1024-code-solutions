## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
  It is a property of DOM elements that allows you to access and manipulate the CSS class(es) applied to an element. It represents a space-separated list of class names associated with the element.

- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
  You do this by assigning the update to the 'className' property.

- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
  It is a property of DOM elements that represents the text content of an element and all it's descendants.

- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  You do this by assigning the update to the 'textContent' property.

- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  No, because you might not need to access any properties of the event object.

- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?

- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
