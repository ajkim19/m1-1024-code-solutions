## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  Code for reuse throughout a program.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

1. The function keyword to begin the creation of a new function.
2. An optional name. (Our function's name is sayHello.)
3. A comma-separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by () parentheses. (Our sayHello function doesn't have any parameters.)
4. The start of the function's code block, as indicated by an { opening curly brace.
5. An optional return statement. (Our sayHello function doesn't have a return statement.)
6. The end of the function's code block, as indicated by a } closing curly brace.

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  This includes the name of the function and parentheses with any arguments.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  The definition states what the function will do while the call executes it.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder variable whose value is not known, whereas an argument is an actual value that will be run in place of parameter where ever it is denoted in the function's code block.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Within the scope of a function, it allows for outside input to be run in the function's code block.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  It allows the function to output a value and proper annotations will help us in case we accidentally pass an incorrect data type into this function.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  Paretheses with parameters, arrow, implicit return statement

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  It has an implicit return, which means that an arrow function can return a value without using the return keyword.
