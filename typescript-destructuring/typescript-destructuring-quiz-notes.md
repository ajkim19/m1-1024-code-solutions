## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?

  - It is extracting properties from objects or elements directly into variables.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?

  - const { property1: alias1, property2: alias2 } = object;

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?

  - const [ variable1, variable2, variable3 ] = array;

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?

  - Destructuring will have the object or array to be destructured on the right, while creation of object or array literals will have values on the right-hand side.
  - Objects use curly braces in their syntax.
  - Array will use brackets in their syntax.
