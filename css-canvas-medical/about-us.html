            <p>
              Our mission is to give clinicians and their teams highly usable,
              intelligent tools to advance their practice of medicine &mdash;
              and improve their day-to-day.

            <p>
              Why did we enter this crowded field? Because medical records have
              fallen dramatically short of their promise to improve the quality
              ad efficiency of health care.Clinicians spend far too long at
              their computers. Workflows are overly restrictive. Valuable
              medical data is left un structured.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are honored, and humbled, when a practice chooses us as their
              technology partner. Medicine is a delicate craft that mixes art
              and science &mdash; technology can help or hinder this craft.
              Working with clinicians across the country, we thing we have begun
              to build something that helps.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Andrew founded Canvas in 2015 after years of seeing his wife Anna
            &mdash; a family nurse practitioner &mdash; sacrifice family time in
            the evenings to &quot;finish&quot; charting. It never ended.
          </p>
          <p>
            Andrew new that the answer wasn't to go out and do it alone. He
            started to fill the gaps in his experience. Seven practicing
            clinicians formed the clinical advisory board &mdash; rather than
            leave practice to work full-time with Canvas, they used and reviewed
            product changes in their practices. Our Medical Director, Dr.
            Zimmerman, joined when he saw the potential of Canvas to help
            independent practices like his practice, Temescal Creek Medicine in
            Oakland, CA. Julian joined Canvas after working at Medicare and
            seeing the failures of current technology to keep up with increasing
            regulatory demands without burdening clinicians. Joe and a world
            class group of software developers joined to accelerate our ability
            to listen to clinician feedback and constantly improve the product.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Canvas, we created a fundamentally different way of charting
            that completely eliminates the need for menus and pop-ups. The name
            of the company describes the charting experience &mdash; it feels
            like a blank canvas where you can tell the patient's story and
            seamlessly complete notes, orders, and chart review on a single,
            unified screen. With seamlessly integrated population health,
            billing, and practice management, Canvas is a reimagined platform
            for the modern primary care practice.
