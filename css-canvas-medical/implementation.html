                  You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have
                  determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
                  unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as
                  much information as possible to make this determination one
                  way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the
                  Canvas application for you to get a feel for the platform as
                  well as references to current customers to talk about their

                  Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and
                  community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over
                  your fax number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse,
                  and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll also load
                  your preferred specialists and imagining centers into Canvas
                  so that sending referrals and closing loops is seamless.
                  Finally, if interfaces with health information exchanges or
                  other information technology vendors are important, we will
                  work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.

                  The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of
                  your current data, which we have executed successfully with
                  both remotely hosted and non-premise EMR databases. Then our
                  work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and
                  information like medications, problems, and allergies is
                  relatively straight forward. While importing clinical notes
                  and documents is more challenging, out team has been able to
                  do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety fo
                  EMRs.

                  We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
                  clinical content, charge schedule, and much more. Role-based
                  trainings will be done a few weeks prior to go-live to
                  familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice
                  management, and billing workflows. Either before or during
                  go-live, one of our team can visit your practice to work
                  side-by-side with you on implementation and training.

                  Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in
                  your practice. We will be with you, either in-person or
                  remotely depending on your preference, to make sure everything
                  goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have
                  a handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing
                  clinical microtemplates, setting up new automations, modifying
                  practice management settings, and more. We are here to help
                  with it all.
