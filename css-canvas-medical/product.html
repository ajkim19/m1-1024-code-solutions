              Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across
              clinicians, staff, and patients themselves &mdash; making you more
              productive, less stressed, and adding just a bit more joy into
              your practice of medicine.

              bounce around five windows to discover the last blood&nbsp;&nbsp;
              count. Canvas pulls everything you need directly into your note,
              so you never have to leave it. And because Canvas learns from
              every interaction, it gets smarter with every patient you see.

              right time, and the product leverages technology to actually
              improve the quality of care I provide.&quot;

              you're a step ahead.

              test in the past 3 months? Which of my patients are on potentially
              unsafe levels of opioids according to the most recent guidelines?
              That doesn't seem like a lot to ask and those are tremendously
              important questions. But I just couldn't get an answer from our

            <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
            <p class="product3-info">
              Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
              performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and
              increase revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols
              and charge capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work
              only they can do.

              &quot;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as
              complex as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to
              keep up. We're a small practice and we don't have a big quality
              team or a group of coders to catch everything. The automation in
              Canvas has completely eliminated my concerns around quality and
              revenue performance.&quot;
